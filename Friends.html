<h3 style= "color: green; font-family: Dancing Script"> Introduction and Plot </h3>

<a href="#"><img class="picR" style= "size=150px;" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.o94JB1ENHbBx2l_RQBXFfgHaF7%26pid%3DApi&f=1" alt="Friends"></a>


Rachel Green, a sheltered but friendly woman, flees her wedding day and wealthy yet unfulfilling life and finds childhood friend Monica Geller, a tightly wound but caring chef. After Rachel becomes a waitress at West Village coffee house Central Perk, she moves into Monica's apartment above Central Perk and joins Monica's group of single friends in their mid-20s: previous roommate Phoebe Buffay, an eccentric, weird masseuse; neighbor Joey Tribbiani, a dim-witted yet loyal struggling actor and womanizer; 


Joey's roommate Chandler Bing, a sarcastic, self-deprecating IT manager; and Monica's older brother and Chandler's college roommate Ross Geller, a sweet-natured but insecure paleontologist.


Episodes depict the friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues, such as Joey auditioning for roles or Rachel seeking jobs in the fashion industry. The six characters each have many dates and serious relationships, such as Monica with Richard Burke and Ross with Emily Waltham. Ross and Rachel's intermittent relationship is the most often-recurring storyline; during the ten seasons of the show, they repeatedly date and break up. Over the course of the series, Ross briefly marries Emily, Ross and Rachel have a child together after a one-night stand, Chandler and Monica date and marry each other, and Phoebe marries Mike Hannigan. Other frequently recurring characters include Ross and Monica's parents Jack and Judy Geller from Long Island; Ross's ex-wife Carol Willick, their son Ben Geller, and Carol's lesbian partner Susan Bunch; Central Perk barista Gunther; Chandler's extremely annoying and obnoxious but good-natured ex-girlfriend Janice Goralnik; and Phoebe's evil twin sister Ursula.

<p class="normal"> Chandler Bing...One of my favourite characters in Friends, is basically, as he describes himself, He is hopeless, and akward and desperate for love. Well he also copes up with the social anxiety he has due to a bad childhood using sarcastic comments and jokes which basically gives the F.R.I.E.N.D.S the charm it has as a sit-com. He first is introduced to date Janice, a weird, but nice and kind lady with whom he has an one-off relationship, most of the times involuntatrily throughout the first 3 seasons.

During Ross's wedding with Emily, he and Monica, Ross's sister hook up because when monica was upset that someone thought that she was the mother of Ross, Chandler consoles her. They fall in love, but decide to hide their relationship in order to avoid complications </p>
